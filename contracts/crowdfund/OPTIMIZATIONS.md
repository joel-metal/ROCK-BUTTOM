# Gas Optimization & Event Documentation

## Storage Optimization Techniques

### 1. Batch Instance Reads (contribute, withdraw, refund_single, refund_batch)

**Before:** Each validation step called `env.storage().instance().get(...)` independently,
paying the storage-access overhead on every call.

**After:** All instance-storage reads are hoisted to the top of the function into a single
`let inst = env.storage().instance();` binding, then all `.get()` calls are made through
that binding before any branching logic.

```rust
// Before — repeated storage handle creation
let status: Status = env.storage().instance().get(&KEY_STATUS).unwrap();
let min: i128      = env.storage().instance().get(&KEY_MIN).unwrap();
let deadline: u64  = env.storage().instance().get(&KEY_DEADLINE).unwrap();

// After — single handle, all reads up-front
let inst = env.storage().instance();
let status: Status = inst.get(&KEY_STATUS).unwrap();
let min: i128      = inst.get(&KEY_MIN).unwrap();
let deadline: u64  = inst.get(&KEY_DEADLINE).unwrap();
```

### 2. Eliminate Redundant Persistent Reads (contribute)

**Before:** `DataKey::Contribution(contributor)` was read twice — once for the max-cap
check and again after the token transfer.

**After:** The contributor's existing balance is read once into `prev_contrib` and reused
for both the cap check and the post-transfer write.

### 3. Cache `ledger().timestamp()` (contribute)

**Before:** `env.ledger().timestamp()` was called separately for the deadline check and
the rate-limit window check.

**After:** Called once into `let now = env.ledger().timestamp();` and reused.

### 4. Eliminate Duplicate `extend_ttl` (withdraw)

**Before:** `env.storage().instance().extend_ttl(17280, 518400)` was called twice in
`withdraw()` — once before the status write and once after.

**After:** A single `inst.extend_ttl(17280, 518400)` call after all writes.

### 5. Batch Instance Writes (initialize)

**Before:** Each field was written with a separate `env.storage().instance().set(...)` call.

**After:** All writes go through a single `let storage = env.storage().instance();` binding.

### 6. Token Address Cached in refund_batch

**Before:** `env.storage().instance().get(&KEY_TOKEN)` was called inside the loop for
every contributor.

**After:** The token address and `token::Client` are created once before the loop and
reused for all transfers.

### 7. Conditional Writes Only When Needed

`LargestContribution` and `ContributorCount` are only written when the value actually
changes, avoiding unnecessary storage writes.

## Event Reference

All state-changing operations emit structured events using typed payload structs defined
in `types.rs`. This makes events indexable and forward-compatible.

| Topic | Payload Type | Emitted When |
|---|---|---|
| `("campaign", "initialized")` | `EventInitialized` | Campaign created via `initialize()` |
| `("campaign", "contributed")` | `EventContributed` | Contribution accepted via `contribute()` |
| `("campaign", "withdrawn")` | `EventWithdrawn` | Creator withdraws via `withdraw()` |
| `("campaign", "refunded")` | `EventRefunded` | Full refund claimed via `refund_single()` or `refund_batch()` |
| `("campaign", "partial_refund")` | `EventPartialRefund` | Partial refund via `refund_partial()` |
| `("campaign", "status_changed")` | `EventStatusChanged` | Any status transition (cancel, pause, unpause) |
| `("campaign", "cancelled")` | `()` | Campaign cancelled via `cancel_campaign()` |
| `("campaign", "paused")` | `()` | Campaign paused via `pause()` |
| `("campaign", "unpaused")` | `()` | Campaign resumed via `unpause()` |
| `("campaign", "metadata_updated")` | `EventMetadataUpdated` | Metadata updated via `update_metadata()` |
| `("campaign", "deadline_extended")` | `EventDeadlineExtended` | Deadline extended via `extend_deadline()` |
| `("campaign", "extension_proposed")` | `EventExtensionProposed` | Extension proposal created |
| `("campaign", "extension_voted")` | `EventExtensionVoted` | Vote cast on extension |
| `("campaign", "extension_executed")` | `EventExtensionExecuted` | Extension executed after voting |
| `("campaign", "recurring_setup")` | `EventRecurringSetup` | Recurring plan created |
| `("campaign", "recurring_executed")` | `EventRecurringExecuted` | Recurring contribution triggered |
| `("campaign", "recurring_cancelled")` | `EventRecurringCancelled` | Recurring plan cancelled |
| `("campaign", "delegation_created")` | `EventDelegationCreated` | Delegation created |
| `("campaign", "delegated_contribution")` | `EventDelegatedContribution` | Contribution made via delegation |
| `("campaign", "delegation_revoked")` | `EventDelegationRevoked` | Delegation revoked |
| `("campaign", "whitelisted")` | `EventWhitelisted` | Address added to whitelist |
| `("campaign", "whitelist_removed")` | `EventWhitelistRemoved` | Address removed from whitelist |
| `("campaign", "blacklisted")` | `EventBlacklisted` | Address added to blacklist |
| `("campaign", "blacklist_removed")` | `EventBlacklistRemoved` | Address removed from blacklist |
| `("campaign", "whitelist_only_set")` | `EventWhitelistOnlySet` | Whitelist-only mode toggled |
| `("campaign", "rate_limit_updated")` | `EventRateLimitUpdated` | Rate limit changed |
| `("campaign", "emergency_initiated")` | `EventEmergencyInitiated` | Emergency withdrawal initiated |
| `("campaign", "emergency_executed")` | `EventEmergencyExecuted` | Emergency withdrawal executed |
| `("campaign", "emergency_cancelled")` | `()` | Emergency withdrawal cancelled |
| `("insurance", "enabled")` | `EventInsuranceEnabled` | Insurance enabled |
| `("insurance", "payout")` | `EventInsurancePayout` | Insurance payout processed |
| `("registry", "registered")` | `Address` | Campaign registered in registry |
